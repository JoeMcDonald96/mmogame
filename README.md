Online crime game where players can create illegal goods using 
supplies. Users create illegal goods by clicking the associated
icons on the city map. Once the player runs out of supplies, they 
can buy more...or risk stealing some from other players. Stealing
uses thieves if unsuccesful but has a chance of taking supplies 
from the targeted player. Supplies and thieves can be purchased 
from the shop. Here, the player can also sell their illegal goods
for money. Players with higher money will be displayed higher on 
the leaderboard.
