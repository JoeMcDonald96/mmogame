Description:
Online crime game where players can create illegal goods using 
supplies. Users create illegal goods by clicking the associated
icons on the city map. Once the player runs out of supplies, they 
can buy more...or risk stealing some from other players. Stealing
uses thieves if unsuccesful but has a chance of taking supplies 
from the targeted player. Supplies and thieves can be purchased 
from the shop. Here, the player can also sell their illegal goods
for money. Players with higher money will be displayed higher on 
the leaderboard.

Gameplay:
A player can have a maximum of 50 supplies, 50 Drugs, 50
Counterfiet Cash & 5 Thieves. 10 supplies are consumed to create
5 drugs or counterfiet cash when their respective icon is clicked 
on the city map. The player can't create goods if they don't have 
atleast 10 supplies. The player can steal supplies from a user. Both 
the targeted user and attacking user must have atleast 10 supplies. 
The attacking user must also have atleast 1 thief and have space to 
store the stolen supplies. If the attack is unsuccesful, the attacking 
user loses 1 thief and 10 supplies. If the attack is successful, 
the attacking user gains 10 of the targeted user's supplies.
